# INTERPRETERS

I'm working through [the book](https://interpreterbook.com/) `writing an interpreter in go` by Thorsten Ball.

Initially I wanna finish it with implementation `in-go` but later extend with different language interpreters

wishlist:
    - writing interpreter in C
    - writing interpreter in Lua
    - writing interpreter in Zig
    - writing interpreter in Rust
    - writing interpreter in OCaml
